		CHANGES IN TIGERS VERSION 0.1-1


BUG FIXES

    o distance_to_arc() now returns the correct answer when the point
      (x,y) is close to an end-point of the arc.

    o A memory leak in the C code of polygon2raster() has been
      fixed. Thin polygons (i.e., spread on a single row of polygons)
      are also correctly handled.
