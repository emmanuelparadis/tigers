		CHANGES IN TIGERS VERSION 0.1-3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o The functions ECEF2lonlat, lonlat2ECEF, lonlat2UTM, UTM2lonlat,
      fast2waytable, BlackBodySpectrum, spectrum2col, wl2col, axisMap,
      and rose have been moved from the package sentinel (which is now
      defunct).



		CHANGES IN TIGERS VERSION 0.1-3


BUG FIXES

    o is.insidePolygon() returned two values when 'points' was not a
      matrix: the vector is now converted as a one-row matrix.



		CHANGES IN TIGERS VERSION 0.1-2


OTHER CHANGES

    o The calculations of polygon area with lon-lat coordinates has
      been removed because of errors in the formulas.



		CHANGES IN TIGERS VERSION 0.1-1


BUG FIXES

    o distance_to_arc() now returns the correct answer when the point
      (x,y) is close to an end-point of the arc.

    o A memory leak in the C code of polygon2raster() has been
      fixed. Thin polygons (i.e., spread on a single row of polygons)
      are also correctly handled.
