# tigers: Tools for Integrating Geography, Environment, and Remote Sensing

'tigers' provides functions for manipulating polygons, coordinates, ...

All the tools programmed in 'tigers' are ``class-free'': they work on numeric vectors or matrices (even data frames) that store coordinates. So the functions in the present package can easily be interfaced with other packages such as 'terra', 'sf', or 'sp'.

The majority of the computations done by 'tigers' are performed by efficient C code which could be interfaced with other languages (e.g., Python).
